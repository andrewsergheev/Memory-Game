### General Features
The application should be able to handle normal mobile device events (such as receiving a phone call or having a poor network connection) in an appropriate manner. The application should function in at least two languages.  The application should function in different orientations, providing different layouts for different orientations when appropriate. Fixing the orientation will not meet this criteria.
### Playing Puzzles
Puzzles can be played. Upon completing a puzzle the user should be given a score based on their performance. Maximum marks for implementing all three scoring metrics. If a puzzle is interrupted upon their return the user should have the option to continue where they left off. The highscores should be retained between sessions.
### Puzzle Management
The user should be able to choose puzzles from those available on the device, or choose to download individual puzzles from a list of puzzles available on the server. Downloaded information should be stored to the device so that the application can function without a network connection. More information about the format of data provided can be found in the Data Format section. Puzzles that have been downloaded should have separate highscores so the user can see how they have done with each of the tile sets.
